# DiaDiary
Uni project. Presented to make diabetics lives easier

DiaDiary is a console project which main purpose is to be a (surprise, surprise) diary for diabetics.
This project has an *interactive* fancy and understandable interface which is pretty unusual to see in console projects.

MongoDB (noSQL) is the datasaver of this project, also it has additional functions, like showing you glycated hemoglobin (indeed, not precisely)

Still much work to do, so follow the updates, if you're interested :D
